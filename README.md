# GRIP Program Internship Project - Banking System Simple Dynamic Website

🚀 Welcome to my Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) project! In this exciting journey, I will be building a simple dynamic website with the following specifications:

## Project Overview

The project involves creating a web application that simulates a basic banking system. It will allow users to perform transactions between customers. Here are the key components and requirements:

### Database

I will start by creating a database with MongoDb. The customers' table will contain basic fields like name, email, and current balance. Additionally, a transfers table will record all transactions that occur.

### Website Flow

The website will have a straightforward flow for users:

1. **Home Page**: The landing page for the website.
2. **View all Customers**: Users can view a list of all customers.
3. **Select and View one Customer**: Clicking on a customer's name will lead to a detailed view.
4. **Transfer Money**: Users can initiate a money transfer from one customer to another.
5. **Select customer to transfer to**: Choose a recipient for the transfer.
6. **View all Customers**: Return to the list of all customers.

### User Experience

- There will be no login page and no user creation functionality.
- The primary purpose of the website is to facilitate money transfers between multiple users.

### Hosting and Version Control

I will host the website on a free hosting provider i.e. Vercel

## Getting Started

To explore and test the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the chosen database and import the dummy data.
3. Host the website using the instructions provided in the project's documentation.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Your input is greatly appreciated!


📦 **Database**: Choose a database system (I am using MONGODB Atlas) for storing customer and transaction data.

🌐 **Website Flow**: Understand the flow of the website, from the home page to money transfers.

🚫 **No Login Page**: This project does not require user authentication or user creation.

🌟 **Hosting and Version Control**: The website will be hosted on a free hosting provider, and the code will be managed using GitLab.
